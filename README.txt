Irtiqa is a text-based adventure game which allows you to navigate through a small world as an animal. Your ultimate goal in
this game is to become dominant over all other animals in this world. Do so, and you win. As you interact more and more with
the world, you will accumulate experience, tools, and abilities that will aid you in your quest for dominance. Use your
experience points to 'evolve' progressively into a more and more powerful (or charming) animal.
You will interact with 
the world using text commands (e.g., "go north" or "eat fruit"). This will also involve interacting with other animals in the
world; whether these interactions are friendly or hostile is up to you. You may attempt to befriend animals, or you may attack
them. The game world is dynamic: the weather changes frequently, and new creatures are born regularly where old ones have died.

OUR IMPROVEMENTS
 - "me" command (2 points): We have included both a "me" command, which lets the player see their most important stats, and an "allstats" command, which lets the player see a comprehensive list of their stats. These commands call the methods stats and allstats of the Player class, respectively, located in the Player.py.
 - bigger world (2 points): Our game has an 8x8 map of Square objects, our game's equivalent of rooms. This map is generated by the makeMap method of the World class, found in World.py. At the beginning of each turn, players see a description of the terrain of the square they're in, as well as whether or not that square has items or a creature in it.
 - "inspect" command (2 points): We have added an inspect command for use on either creatures or items. When used on a creature, it tells the player that creature's stats. When used on an item, it describes the item's function. The "inspect" command calls the inspect method of the Player class.
 - limited inventory (2 points): Each item in the game has a weight, and the player is limited in both the quantity and the weight of items they can carry. However, the player can upgrade their weight limit and their inventory capacity using the evolve method of the Player class.
 - "drop" command (2 points): We have added a "drop" command so that a player can drop items. The "drop" command calls the drop method of the Player class.
 - weapons (2 points): Not weapons per se, but there are certain items that the player can use during encounters with other creatures that help the player to defeat or befriend them.
 - healing items (2 points): Food and the item "healing salve" both heal the player. Additionally, the different types of food heal the player to different degrees.
 - item stacking (2 points): There is item stacking both when listing the items in the player's inventory (in the showInventory method of the Player class) and when listing the items in the player's location (in the printSituation function of Main.py).
 - introducing monsters during play (2 points): New monsters appear every five turns. This is accomplished in the update method of the World class.
 - "wait" command (2 points): The player can wait any number of turns. The code for this is in Main.py.
 - regeneration (2 points): The player regenerates stats when they are at their home base. Additionally, terrain and weather effects can damage the player's stats over time (which is akin to negative regeneration). These effects are carried out in the update method of the Player class.
 - victory conditions (3 points): There are three ways to beat the game: by defeating 20 creatures, by befriend 20 creatures, or by unlocking "fire" from the upgrade store.
 - random world (3 points): The world is entirely random. The terrain is random (implemented in the makeMap method of the World class), the distribution of items is random (in Main.py), and the distribution of creatures is random (in Main.py).
