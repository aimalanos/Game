Irtiqa is a text-based adventure game which allows you to navigate through a small world as an animal. Your ultimate goal in
this game is to become dominant over all other animals in this world. Do so, and you win. As you interact more and more with
the world, you will accumulate experience, tools, and abilities that will aid you in your quest for dominance. Use your
experience points to 'evolve' progressively into a more and more powerful (or charming) animal.
You will interact with 
the world using text commands (e.g., "go north" or "eat fruit"). This will also involve interacting with other animals in the
world; whether these interactions are friendly or hostile is up to you. You may attempt to befriend animals, or you may attack
them. The game world is dynamic: the weather changes frequently, and new creatures are born regularly where old ones have died.
